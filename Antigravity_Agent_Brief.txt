Project goal

Create a beautifully formatted, mobile-first static site for a Parent’s Guide. All longform copy must live in Markdown files under /content/sections. Structured elements, such as tools and checklists, live in JSON. The front end uses Astro + Tailwind. Menus and routing are driven by content/index.json. No long prose in components.

Inputs and working directory

Working directory: /ParentGuideApp/

Source content: source/parent-guide.md
If missing, use source/Summarised Parent's Guide.docx → convert to Markdown first.

Images already present:

content/images/hero.jpg

content/images/calm.jpg

GitHub repo for deployment: https://github.com/dallylee/ParentsGuide

Deliverables

Content pack in /content/:

content/index.json (site index, routing, ordering)

content/sections/*.md (10 sections, see IA below)

content/tools/*.json (4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, worry-time)

content/checklists/*.json (hospital bag, discharge readiness)

content/data/crisis-contacts.json (UK: 999, NHS 111, Samaritans 116 123)

Use and reference the supplied images

Front end in /site/ using Astro + Tailwind:

Mobile-first layout with a home card grid

Pastel theme; soft glowing card shadows

Bottom navigation with five items: Home, Tools, Timeline, Support, Search

Each menu item opens a separate page, not a long scroller

Deployment:

Commit project to the existing GitHub repo

GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy to GitHub Pages

Astro output to site/dist

README.md at repo root with editing workflow

Information architecture

Create these primary sections as separate Markdown pages:

Start here

Understanding your worries

Your calm toolkit

Talking with your child

Timeline before hospital

Hospital day

Home recovery

Daily self-care

When to get extra support

Growing stronger

Create these structured assets:

Tools: 4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, worry-time

Checklists: hospital bag (child and parent), discharge readiness

Data: crisis contacts for the UK

Content transformation

Parse source/parent-guide.md.

Split into ten section Markdown files under content/sections/, keeping existing headings as #, ##, ###.

Extract checklists and step sequences to JSON with stable ids.

Extract short, repeatable techniques to content/tools/*.json.

If present, extract “say this / avoid that” pairs into content/scripts/*.json with {say, avoid, why}.

Generate content/index.json with this shape and real values:

{
  "version": 1,
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "start",
      "title": "Start here",
      "slug": "start",
      "order": 1,
      "menu": "primary",
      "summary": "Reassurance, why your calm matters, where to begin.",
      "tags": ["orientation","anxiety"],
      "est_read": 3,
      "body": "sections/01-start-here.md",
      "hero_image": "images/hero.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "quick_tools": [
    { "id": "breathing-478", "title": "4-7-8 breathing", "data": "tools/breathing-478.json", "image": "images/calm.jpg" },
    { "id": "grounding-54321", "title": "5-4-3-2-1 grounding", "data": "tools/grounding-54321.json" },
    { "id": "worry-time", "title": "Worry-time", "data": "tools/worry-time.json" }
  ],
  "checklists": [
    { "id": "hospital-bag", "title": "Hospital bag", "data": "checklists/hospital-bag.json" },
    { "id": "discharge", "title": "Discharge readiness", "data": "checklists/discharge.json" }
  ],
  "support": { "crisis_contacts": "data/crisis-contacts.json" }
}


Add front matter to each Markdown file mirroring metadata, for future rebuilds:

---
title: "Start here"
slug: "start"
order: 1
menu: "primary"
summary: "Reassurance, why your calm matters, where to begin."
tags: ["orientation","anxiety"]
est_read: 3
hero_image: "images/hero.jpg"
---


End each page with a short “What to do next” linking to the next logical page.

Use British English, short paragraphs optimised for mobile.

Image handling

Use content/images/hero.jpg on Home and the “Start here” page.

Use content/images/calm.jpg on the breathing tool page and where supportive.

If the source contains additional images, place extracted copies under content/images/auto/ and reference relatively.

Generate WebP variants at build time and prefer them via <picture>.

<img> must be responsive with max-width: 100% and descriptive alt.

Design system and styles

Theme variables (Tailwind or CSS variables):

--bg: #f7faf9;

--card: #ffffff;

--text: #1f2937; /* slate-800 */

--pastel-4: #f5e8ff; /* purple */

Cards:

Rounded corners: rounded-xl

Border: subtle border border-black/5

Padding: p-4 md:p-6

Glow shadow: two layers

Ambient: shadow-[0_6px_16px_rgba(31,41,55,0.08)]

Colour glow: shadow-[0_0_24px_var(--glow)]

Rotate --glow across cards using the pastel variables for variety.

Typography:

System UI stack, base 16–18 px, comfortable line height, headings with clear hierarchy.

Layout:

Single column on mobile, generous vertical rhythm.

Sticky bottom bar with five items; labels always visible.

Accessibility:

Tap targets ≥ 44 px.

Focus outlines visible.

Colour contrast compliant.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Front end requirements (Astro + Tailwind)

Routes

/ Home, card grid fed by content/index.json

/section/[slug] Markdown detail pages

/tools list of tools

/tool/[id] tool detail (timer or steps)

/timeline timeline summary based on section data

/support contacts and red flags

/search client-side search

Home

Hero area with images/hero.jpg and the “Start here” summary line.

Cards for primary sections and quick tools; alternate pastel glow.

Components

SectionPage: fetch Markdown body, auto-build “Jump to” from ## headings.

ToolBreathing: read tools/breathing-478.json; minimal inhale/hold/exhale timer.

Checklist: read checklist JSON; persist ticks in localStorage.

Search: small index from title, summary, tags, and headings; cache locally.

BottomNav: Home, Tools, Timeline, Support, Search.

Content loading

On boot, fetch and cache content/index.json.

Lazy-load Markdown or JSON per route.

Invalidate cache when index.json.version increments.
