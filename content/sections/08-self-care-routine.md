# Your Daily Self-Care Routine

This simple, non-negotiable checklist is not meant to be another burden. Think of these small actions as the essential daily maintenance required to keep your own well full, so you have the strength and patience to continue caring for your child.

*   **Morning Centering (2-5 minutes):** Before diving into the day's demands, take three slow, deep breaths, do a few gentle stretches, and repeat a positive affirmation, such as, *"I can handle whatever today brings."*

*   **Nutrition and Hydration Check:** Plan when you will eat your main meals. Keep healthy snacks and a water bottle handy at all times to maintain stable energy levels and mood.

*   **Scheduled Worry Time (15-20 minutes):** Designate a specific daily time slot for worrying or reflection. During this time, write your concerns in a journal or think them through. When the time is up, consciously close the book on those worries until the next day.

*   **Breathing Breaks Throughout the Day:** Prevent stress from accumulating with mini-resets. Link a single deep breath to a common activity. For example, every time you wash your hands, take one slow, deep inhale and exhale.

*   **Evening Wind-Down (20-30 minutes):** Create a routine to signal to your body and mind that it's time to rest. Dim the lights, avoid stimulating screens, listen to calming music, or do some gentle stretches.

*   **Daily Connection and Gratitude:** Connect with a loved one each day, whether through a text, call, or chat. Before bed, note one thing you are grateful for or proud of, no matter how small.

These small, consistent actions are the building blocks of resilience. But sometimes, even with the best tools, the stress can feel like too much. Let's talk about what to do when these daily practices are not enough.
