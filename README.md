Parent’s Guide to Child’s Surgery

A calm, supportive guide to help parents prepare for a child’s surgery, emotionally and practically.

This project began as a personal response to a real situation. A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery, and like many parents in that position, they were understandably anxious and overwhelmed. While medical teams provide excellent clinical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to remain a steady presence for their child.

This guide brings together evidence-informed guidance from trusted sources such as the NHS, Mayo Clinic, the British Psychological Society, and paediatric psychology research, and presents it in a gentle, accessible way.

It is not intended to replace medical advice, but to offer structure, preparation, reassurance, and simple, proven calming techniques.
