# Parent’s Guide to Child’s Surgery

A calm, evidence-informed web app designed to support parents when their child is facing surgery.

---

## About this project

This app began as a **personal passion project**.

A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery, and like most parents in that situation, they were understandably overwhelmed, anxious, and unsure how best to prepare, emotionally as well as practically. While hospitals provide excellent clinical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to be a steady, reassuring presence for their child.

This project was created to help bridge that gap.

I gathered **scientifically supported guidance** from trusted, reputable sources, including:

- NHS (UK)
- Mayo Clinic
- British Psychological Society
- Paediatric psychology and perioperative anxiety research

The goal was to translate this evidence into a **gentle, structured, and accessible guide** that parents could return to at their own pace.

- **Clear preparation structure**  
  Step-by-step guidance covering the weeks before surgery, the hospital experience, and early recovery.

- **Emotional reassurance grounded in research**  
  Explains why a parent’s calm matters and how children take emotional cues from caregivers.

- **Practical planning tools**  
  Notes, timelines, checklists, and prompts to reduce cognitive load during stressful periods.

- **Proven calming exercises**  
  Evidence-based techniques such as breathing, grounding, and scheduled worry, adapted into simple, interactive tools.

  Informative without being overwhelming, reassuring without being dismissive.

## Philosophy

This app is not intended to replace medical advice or clinical care.

It exists to support parents so that they can:
- feel more prepared
- feel less alone
- regulate their own anxiety
- be the calm, reassuring presence their child needs during surgery and recovery

Sometimes structure, clarity, and a few proven techniques can make an enormous difference.
