Parent’s Guide to Child’s Surgery

A calm, supportive guide for parents

* About this project

This guide began as a personal response to a real situation.

A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery. Like many parents in that position, they were understandably anxious and overwhelmed. While medical teams provide excellent clinical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to remain a steady, reassuring presence for their child.

This project was created to help fill that gap.

The guide brings together evidence-informed guidance from trusted sources, including:

NHS

Mayo Clinic

British Psychological Society

Paediatric psychology research on anxiety and recovery

All content is presented in a gentle, accessible way.

* Purpose

This guide is not intended to replace medical advice.

Its purpose is to offer:

structure during an uncertain time

preparation steps you can return to at your own pace

reassurance grounded in research

simple, proven calming techniques

The focus is on clarity, calm, and emotional support.
