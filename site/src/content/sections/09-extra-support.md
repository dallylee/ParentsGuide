# When You Need Extra Support

Seeking help is not a sign of failure. It is a proactive, strong, and intelligent step to ensure the wellbeing of your entire family. Just as your child needs a team of medical experts, you sometimes need a team of emotional support.

## Red Flags That You Need Additional Support

If you experience any of the following symptoms persistently (most days for more than a week or two), it's a clear sign that it's time to reach out for help.

*   **Emotional:** Persistent depression, hopelessness, frequent panic attacks, unusual irritability or anger outbursts.
*   **Functional:** Inability to perform necessary duties (like remembering medications), severe sleep disturbances even when you have the opportunity, neglecting your own basic needs.
*   **Behavioural:** Withdrawing from friends and family, excessive use of alcohol or sedatives to cope.
*   **Physical:** Chronic headaches, stomachaches, fatigue, or constantly getting sick.

## Avenues for Help

There are many resources available to support you through this challenging time.

*   **Professional Psychological Support:** A therapist or counselor can provide a safe space to process your feelings and teach you tailored coping skills.
*   **Hospital Resources:** Your child's hospital is a key resource. Speak to the **Paediatric Psychologists**, **Child Life Specialists**, or **Social Workers** on your team. They understand the unique stressors of the medical environment.
*   **Peer Networks:** Talking to other parents who truly "get it" can be incredibly validating. Ask about hospital-facilitated support groups or search for reputable online communities.
*   **Your Personal Network:** Don't be afraid to lean on family and friends. Be specific in your requests: *"Could you come sit with my child for an hour so I can take a nap?"*
*   **Other Professional Support:** Your **GP** can be a great first point of contact for referrals. If your employer offers an **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**, it can provide confidential counseling. **Faith or spiritual support** from hospital chaplains or your own community can also be a source of great comfort.

## For Immediate Crisis

**If you ever feel unable to keep yourself or your child safe, contact emergency services or a crisis hotline immediately.**

*   **NHS Mental Health Crisis Line:** Call 111 (select the mental health option)
*   **Samaritans:** Call 116 123 (available 24/7)
*   **Emergency Services:** Call 999

Reaching out for help is an act of empowerment. Now, let's look beyond the immediate crisis toward long-term healing and growth for your entire family.
