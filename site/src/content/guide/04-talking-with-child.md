## Talking with Your Child

One of the most daunting tasks for any parent is figuring out how to talk about surgery without causing fear. This is an incredibly important conversation, and the goal is to communicate with "warm honesty"—providing your child with the information they need to feel safe and prepared, not scared.

### The Foundation of Calm Communication

Before you begin any conversation, take a moment to calm yourself. Do a few deep breaths and choose a quiet, relaxed time. Children are highly attuned to your tone of voice and body language. Speaking slowly and gently, even if you feel anxious inside, conveys a powerful message of safety and reassurance.

### Strategies for Honest, Age-Appropriate Language

Honesty is crucial for building and maintaining trust. Children can often sense when information is being withheld, which can increase their anxiety. When they feel misled, it erodes the trust they have in you and the medical team. The key is to be truthful in a way that is simple, clear, and child-friendly.

How you phrase things can make a world of difference. Certain words can be unintentionally frightening, while others can be reassuring.

| Say This | Not That |
|----|----|
| "The doctor will **fix** or **help** your back" | "The doctor will **cut** your back" |
| "You'll get special **sleep medicine** so you won't feel anything" | "They will **put you to sleep**" |
| "When you wake up, you **might feel sore**, but the nurses will give you medicine to help" | "It won't hurt at all, don't worry" (if untrue) |
| "It's **okay to be scared or to cry**. Even grown-ups feel scared sometimes" | "Be brave, big kids don't cry" or "There's nothing to be afraid of" |
| "Do you have **any questions**? You can ask me anything" | "You probably don't want to know about that" |
| "Mum/Dad will stay with you **as much as possible**" | "I'll never leave your side for a second" (if unrealistic) |

### Encouraging Expression

Create an atmosphere where your child feels safe to ask anything. You can start by asking what they already know or are wondering about. If they ask a difficult question, answer it with calm reassurance.

- **"Will I die?"** *"This surgery is very safe. The doctors do it all the time. I know it's scary to think about, but they have a whole team making sure you stay safe. I believe you will be okay."*

- **"Will it hurt?"** *"Yes, you will have some pain afterward, but it's part of healing and they will give you medicine so it won't hurt too much. We'll manage it together."*

### Modeling Resilience

Children learn how to handle difficult situations by watching you. You can model healthy coping skills by verbalizing your own feelings and demonstrating a solution. For example: *"I'm feeling a little nervous too, so I'm going to take some deep breaths to help my body feel calm."* Then, take those breaths with them. This shows them a concrete action they can take when they feel the same way.

By communicating with warm honesty and projecting confidence, you can significantly reduce your child's fear of the unknown. You've prepared yourself; now let's prepare for the journey itself.
