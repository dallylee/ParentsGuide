## Start Here: You're Not Alone

Taking a breath right now is okay. Whatever you're feeling as you read this—fear, exhaustion, worry, or even numbness—is completely normal. You are facing one of the most difficult challenges a parent can experience: supporting your child through surgery. This guide is designed to offer immediate reassurance and provide you with a toolkit of evidence-based strategies, because your emotional state is a critical component of your child's care.

It's important to know from the start that you are not the only one feeling this way. Research shows that **up to 74% of parents experience significant anxiety** before their child's surgery. This feeling is widespread because your love for your child is deep, and their safety is your highest priority.

Children are remarkably perceptive; they look to you as their **barometer of safety**. They read your face, tone, and body language to understand how they should feel about a situation. Research clearly shows that a parent's anxiety level is highly correlated with their child's preoperative fear. When parents are very anxious, children tend to experience more distress, higher postoperative pain levels, slower recovery, and even lingering behavioural issues that can last weeks or months. Conversely, a parent who can remain relatively calm provides a stabilizing presence that helps a child cope more effectively.

Some parents feel that focusing on their own stress is selfish, but the opposite is true. Managing your own anxiety is one of the most direct and powerful ways you can help your child. Think of the oxygen mask instruction on an aeroplane: you must secure your own mask before you can effectively help others. A parent who is overwhelmed and running on empty cannot provide the steady, comforting presence their child needs most.

You can learn to handle your fear and be the calm anchor your child needs. Let’s begin by understanding the nature of the worries you're facing.
