## Growing Stronger Together

Once you are through the most intense phases of crisis and recovery, you have an opportunity to process your shared experience, celebrate your family's success, and consciously build on the strength you have discovered together.

### Process and Integrate the Experience

In a month or two, when things have settled, hold a "Family Debrief." This is a time to talk openly about what you all went through. Emphasize how everyone contributed—your child's bravery, your steady support, and your other children's patience. This process helps turn a scary event into a powerful story of teamwork and coping.

### Maintain Healthy Habits

You likely developed some new practices during this time that were incredibly helpful, such as mindfulness exercises or regular family walks. Consider keeping these as part of your regular family life to continue fostering connection and wellbeing.

### Celebrate Milestones and Find Closure

It is vital to acknowledge and celebrate your progress. When your child hits a major recovery milestone—like being cleared for normal activities—mark the occasion! You might also create a memory box or scrapbook with cards and photos to honor what you overcame, and then psychologically "close" the chapter by storing it away.

### Reflect on Your Resilience

Take a moment to stop and acknowledge your own strength. You have navigated an extremely challenging experience, learned new coping skills, and successfully supported your child through a major medical event. Instead of focusing on the moments where you felt weak, reframe your experience by the fact that you persevered. You kept going. That is success. That is resilience.

### Final Words of Encouragement

You have just absorbed a great deal of information. Please don't feel you need to master it all at once. The most important things to remember are these:

- You are **not alone** in feeling this way.

- Your **wellbeing matters**—caring for yourself is caring for your child.

- You have **tools** that can help you stay grounded.

- Help is **available** if you need it, and asking for it is a sign of strength.

- You are strong enough to get through this.

Take it one moment, one breath, and one day at a time.

**You've got this.**
