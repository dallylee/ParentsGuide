          This guide began as a personal project.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-800 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed font-medium">
          A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery. Like many parents in that situation, they were understandably
          anxious, overwhelmed, and unsure how best to prepare, both practically and emotionally.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-800 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed font-medium">
          While hospitals provide excellent medical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to be a
          steady, reassuring presence for their child. This guide was created to help fill that gap.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-800 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed font-medium">
          The content is informed by well-established guidance and research from trusted sources, including the NHS, Mayo Clinic,
          the British Psychological Society, and paediatric psychology research on anxiety and recovery.
