        <h1>About this guide</h1>
        <p>This guide began as a personal project.</p>
        <p>A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery. Like many parents in that situation, they were understandably anxious, overwhelmed, and unsure how best to prepare, both practically and emotionally.</p>
        <p>While hospitals provide excellent medical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to be a steady, reassuring presence for their child. This guide was created to help fill that gap.</p>
        <p>The content is informed by well-established guidance and research from trusted sources, including the NHS, Mayo Clinic, the British Psychological Society, and paediatric psychology research on anxiety and recovery.</p>
        <p>This guide is not a substitute for medical advice. It is designed to offer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>structure during an uncertain time</li>
          <li>preparation steps you can return to at your own pace</li>
          <li>reassurance grounded in evidence</li>
          <li>gentle, proven calming techniques</li>
        </ul>
