        <h1>About this guide</h1>

        <p>This guide began as a personal project.</p>

        <p>
          A close friend’s child was scheduled for major surgery. Like many parents in that situation,
          they were understandably anxious, overwhelmed, and unsure how best to prepare, both practically and emotionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          While hospitals provide excellent medical care, parents are often left to manage their own stress while trying to be a steady,
          reassuring presence for their child. This guide was created to help fill that gap.
        </p>

        <p>
          The content is informed by well-established guidance and research from trusted sources, including the NHS, Mayo Clinic,
          the British Psychological Society, and paediatric psychology research on anxiety and recovery.
        </p>

        <p>This guide is not a substitute for medical advice. It is designed to offer:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>structure during an uncertain time</li>
          <li>preparation steps you can return to at your own pace</li>
          <li>reassurance grounded in evidence</li>
          <li>gentle, proven calming techniques</li>
        </ul>
